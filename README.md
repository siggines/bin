# Stardict
The 'Stardict' files are dictionaries for English and Spanish, so thay I can translate words between the languages through the terminal. 
This is useful as I need not specify what language to convert to what, I just have to type a word - if it is English it will translate
to spanish and vice-versa.

# Dotfiles
Config file for my shell zsh, et cetera.
